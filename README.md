# Module: Current Weather (WeatherData)

The `wd-currentweather` module is based on the `currentweather` module, one of the default modules of the MagicMirror. It receives weather data from the [weatherdata](https://github.com/jdcasey/weatherdata) module, which currently draws data from OpenWeatherMaps.org.
